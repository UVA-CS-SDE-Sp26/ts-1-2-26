Cipher Tests

1. When a valid cipher key file is present, the cipher should load the key without errors.

2. When the cipher key file is missing, the cipher should report an error instead of crashing.

3. When the key file does not contain exactly two lines, the cipher should reject the key and report an error.

4. When the key file contains duplicate letters, the cipher should detect the invalid key and report an error.

5. When the input text contains only alphabetic characters, the cipher should correctly decipher all letters using the key.

6. When the input text contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, the cipher should preserve the original letter casing.

7. When the input text contains non-alphabetic characters (such as spaces or punctuation), those characters should remain unchanged.

8. When an alternate cipher key is provided and the key is valid, the cipher should use the alternate key instead of the default key.

9. When an alternate cipher key is provided but is invalid, the cipher should report an error and not attempt to decipher the text.
