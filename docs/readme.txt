# TopSecret Program

Before running the program, run the command

`javac -d . src/main/java/*.java`

from the project root. Then, while still in the root, run the program with the command

`java TopSecret`

for directions.

All subsequent runs using `java TopSecret` must be from the root, otherwise the program will not be able to read the
correct files.
